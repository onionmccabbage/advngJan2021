  - ngFor needs to iterate and will possibly give errors 
  - iterate over the data
- how can we show 'loading' while we load the data - then act on loaded data...
  use life-cycle event hooks, and load the component when the data has loaded
- rxjs pipes let you notify state when async data appears
> subscription: every subscription is destroyed when component is destroyed
> manually unsubscribe too
- life-cycle events
- change detection: onPush
- Forms
- Review Exercise
- rxjs, combining data with advanced operators
- Ivy
- Shadow DOM
> bind to an object collection - see https://angular.io/api/common/KeyValuePipe
