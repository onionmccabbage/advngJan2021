========================= until 3:55
In the existing app:
Generate a 'data' component and write two <input> tags and a button
You should show the values from the fields in the component
Make the button text configurable via @Input 

The component will be used for 'category' and 'id'

Consider good archicture

Optional
--------
Use @Output to send data to the parent
Configure a default (click) handler for the button which then emits a custom event
Handle this custom event in the parent component
maybe use ngIf to conditionally show optional content
